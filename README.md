# BodyFatPredictor

## Project Overview

**BodyFatPredictor** is a web application designed to accurately predict body fat percentage based on various physical measurements. The application leverages a machine learning model to provide users with personalized insights into their body composition.

### Features

- **Predict Body Fat Percentage:** Users can input their physical measurements and get an accurate prediction of their body fat percentage.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy to use the application.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Fast and efficient predictions using a trained machine learning model.

### How It Works

1. **Data Input:** Users enter their physical measurements into the form provided on the web application.
2. **Prediction:** The measurements are sent to the server, where the machine learning model processes the data and provides a prediction.
3. **Result Display:** The predicted body fat percentage is displayed to the user.

### Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dileepsaimanthena/BodyFatPredictor.git
   cd BodyFatPredictor
```
### Install Node.js Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### Set Up Python Environment (if required):

Create a virtual environment and install the necessary Python packages:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  
### On Windows use 
`.venv\Scripts\activate`
### Installation

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the Application:

Start the Node.js server:
```bash
npm start
```
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

### Usage
Open the application in your web browser.
Enter the required physical measurements into the form.
Click the "Predict" button to get the estimated body fat percentage.
View the result on the prediction page.
